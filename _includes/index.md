Tutorial 7 of COMP435p: Biometrics Authentication

[Word version of this tutorial](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Tutorial%207.doc)

### 1. Answer the following questions ###

  + **(a)** Understand why use face (*P8: 3-4*) and face recognition system (*P8: 5-10*).

  + **(b)** Please point out some problems of face recognition. Can you give their solutions?  (*P8: 11-16*)

  + **(c)** What are the general 3 steps of face recognition?  (*P8:17*)

  + **(d)** There are two kinds of the methods in face detection and location, which  are statistics-based and knowledge-based method. What difference between them? (*P8: 18-22*)

  + **(e)** There are five methods of face feature extraction (*P8: 24-41*). Please give their basic ideas.

  + **(f)** What are the advantages and disadvantages of face recognition? (*P8: 48*)



### 2. 	Understand the eigenfaces algorithm (*P8: 26-29*) and eigenfaces recognition algorithm (*P8: 30-31*). ###


### 3. 	Eigenface is PCA-based method which is introduced in Lecture 5. At the fifth step of PCA method (*P5:23-24*) the k most principal components are selected based on the ratio (r<sub>λ</sub>) of the eigenvalue sum of selected components to the total sum. Please decide the value of k when the threshold of r<sub>λ</sub> is 95%.  In *P8:31* there is a training set including 27 facial images to get eigenfaces. Can you give the value of k according to the training result (eigenfaces)?  (<font color=darkred>*7; 9*</font>) ###


### 4. 	*P8:34* shows some examples of local features. Please try to define the geometry features based on the woman's face image (refer to *P8:34*) and give the number of features.  (<font color=darkred>*21*</font>) ###
