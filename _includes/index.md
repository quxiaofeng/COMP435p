### 1. Answer the following questions ###

  + **(a)** Understand why use face (*[P8: 3-4](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*) and face recognition system (*[P8: 5-10](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*).

  + **(b)** Please point out some problems of face recognition. Can you give their solutions?  (*[P8: 11-16](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*)

  + **(c)** What are the general 3 steps of face recognition?  (*[P8:17](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*)

  + **(d)** There are two kinds of the methods in face detection and location, which  are statistics-based and knowledge-based method. What difference between them? (*[P8: 18-22](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*)

  + **(e)** There are five methods of face feature extraction (*[P8: 24-41](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*). Please give their basic ideas.

  + **(f)** What are the advantages and disadvantages of face recognition? (*[P8: 48](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*)



### 2. 	Understand the eigenfaces algorithm (*[P8: 26-29](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*) and eigenfaces recognition algorithm (*[P8: 30-31](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*). ###


### 3. 	Eigenface is PCA-based method which is introduced in Lecture 5. At the fifth step of PCA method (*[P5:23-24](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%205.pdf)*) the k most principal components are selected based on the ratio (r<sub>λ</sub>) of the eigenvalue sum of selected components to the total sum. Please decide the value of k when the threshold of r<sub>λ</sub> is 95%.  In *[P8:31](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)* there is a training set including 27 facial images to get eigenfaces. Can you give the value of k according to the training result (eigenfaces)?  (<font color=darkred>*7; 9*</font>) ###


### 4. 	*[P8:34](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)* shows some examples of local features. Please try to define the geometry features based on the woman's face image (refer to *[P8:34](http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/comp435p/Lecture%208.pdf)*) and give the number of features.  (<font color=darkred>*21*</font>) ###
